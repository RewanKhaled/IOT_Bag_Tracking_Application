# IoT Bag Monitoring Service  

An IoT web application for monitoring the status and location of handbags/backpacks in real time.  
This project was developed as part of the **IoT Applications Development** course assignment.  

## üìå Overview  
This application allows users to track their bags and get alerts if the bag is opened or leaves a predefined geofenced area.  
A Bag IoT device is placed inside each handbag, equipped with:  
- **Light sensor** ‚Äì Detects whether the bag is opened or closed.  
- **GPS sensor** ‚Äì Tracks the bag‚Äôs current location.  

Both **customers** (bag owners) and **customer service agents** have dedicated interfaces to register, monitor, and manage bags.

## üóÇ Project Pages  
The system includes the following pages:  

- **Customer Service Agent** ‚Äì Interface for adding/registering bags, defining sensors, and linking bags to their owners.  
- **Map Last Status** ‚Äì Displays the bag‚Äôs latest known location on a map.  
- **NavBar** ‚Äì Common navigation bar used across all pages.  
- **Historical Locations** ‚Äì Shows past locations of the bag in a timeline format.  
- **Log In** ‚Äì Secure login for end users using Bag ID and password.  
- **Mobile Customer Service** ‚Äì Mobile-friendly version of the customer service page.  
- **Mobile Historical Locations** ‚Äì Mobile view for historical tracking.  
- **Mobile Map** ‚Äì Mobile-friendly page to show the bag‚Äôs current location on a map.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
- **Bag Registration:** Customer service can register a new bag, assign sensors, and store owner info.  
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Displays current bag location using Google Maps.  
- **Open/Close Status:** Uses light intensity readings to show if the bag is open.  
- **Historical Tracking:** View past locations of the bag.  
- **Geofencing:** Triggers an event and sends an alert if the bag leaves a specified radius.  
- **Email Alerts:** Sends an email notification when the bag is opened or leaves the geofenced area.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack  
- **IoT Sensors:** GPS, Light Intensity (Virtual Sensors).  
- **Frontend:** Web pages with map plugin and form generator.  
- **Backend:** Virtual sensor data processing and geofencing logic.  
- **Notifications:** Email alerts for monitored events.

## üöÄ Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Create a folder called `images/` and place your screenshots inside it.  
3. Deploy the project on your IoT platform (with virtual sensors configured).  
4. Configure Bag IDs and owners using the **Customer Service Agent** page.  
5. Use the **Map Last Status** or **Mobile Map** page to track bags in real time.
